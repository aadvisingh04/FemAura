# ü©∫ What is PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome)? 
> "One in five(20%) Indian women suffers from PCOS" ~ The Hindu.
* PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a hormonal disorder affecting women of reproductive age.
* It involves small ovarian cysts, hormonal imbalances, and excess androgens.
* Common symptoms include irregular periods, excessive hair growth, acne, and weight gain.
* Insulin resistance also contributes to its development.

> PCOS is the leading cause of infertility in women.
* In India, the incidence of PCOS is higher among urban women than rural women.
* Liestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, can help manage PCOS symptoms.
> while there is no cure for PCOS, early diagnosis and management can improve quality of life and prevent long-term health complications such as diabetes and heart disease.

# üåü Features:
* **PCOS Detection**: ML model analyzes user input to assess PCOS risk and recommend doctor consultation.

* **Symptom Tracking**: Monitor PCOS-related symptoms to identify health patterns early.

* **Gynecologist AI Bot**: Chatbot offering gynecological advice, answers, and emotional support.

* **Personalized Fitness & Nutrition**: Customized fitness and diet plans for a healthier lifestyle.



# üîç PCOS-Detection:
| Model | Accuracy | 
| --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | 55% |
| Decision Tree | 48% | 
| Support Vector Machine | 54% | 
| Random Forest Classifier | 63% |
| XG Boost | 76% | 

* Performed Data Preprocessing, Data Analysis, applied Scaling, tried models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classfier, XG Boost.
* This model uses XG Boost + SMOTE to classify whether the person has high chances of PCOS and should reach out to a doctor.
* We are using following features:
    `[
        'Age', 
        'Height (cm)', 
        'Weight (kg)', 
        'BMI', 
        'Cycle Length (days)', 
        'Cycle Regular (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Missed Period (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Marital Status (1=Married, 0=Unmarried)', 
        'Hirsutism (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Hair Thinning (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Acne (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Skin Darkening (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Pelvic Pain (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Weight Gain (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Difficulty in Conceiving (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Exercise (1=Regular, 0=No)', 
        'Stress Level (1-5)', 
        'Sugar Craving (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Sleep Well (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Mood Swings (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Family History of PCOS (1=Yes, 0=No)', 
        'Avg Menstrual Duration (days)'
    ]`
